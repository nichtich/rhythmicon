# Theory of Rhythms

*This page has just been started and will be updated soon.*

A rhythm is a repeated pulsation, a string of evenly spaced pulses, some of which are sounded (beats) while other are silent (rests) [@Toussaint2013, p. 5]

There are 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> possible rhythms in a sequence of _n_ pulses, but some of these are more interesting then others.

## How many core rhythms exist?

The total number of **core rythms** is the number of *aperiodic composition of the number of pulses with more than one part*. So this number of interesting, individual rhythms is almost identical to [A000740](https://oeis.org/A00740):

- 1 core rhythm in 1 pulse
- 0 core rhythm in 2 pulses
- 1 core rhythms in 3 pulse
- 2 core rhythms in 4 pulse
- 4 core rhythms in 5 pulse
- 14? core rhythms in 6 pulse
- 27? core rhythms in 7 pulse
- 62? core rhythms in 8 pulse
